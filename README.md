# example-NodeJs-service
A simple NodeJs service to compare with different frameworks

A single endpoint which retrieves data from a Mongo

`curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/books`

**Stack:**
- NodeJs
- Express
- Mongoose

### Setup Mongo

You can also setup a local Mongo running from a local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) image. Pull the [Mongo image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) and run remembering to use the **-p** option to the port. e.g:

`docker run -p 27017:27017 --name some-mongo mongo`

### NodeJs features
* event-loop execution model:
    - asynchronous and non-blocking IO
    - single threaded
    - different styles to unblock event loop, callbacks, promises and async/await
* notes:
    - [dont-block-the-event-loop](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/dont-block-the-event-loop/)
    - parallelism by multiple processes
    - Node excels for I/O-bound work, but for expensive computation it might not be the best option.
